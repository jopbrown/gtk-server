gtk-server.cfg - Configfile for the gtk-server.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<B>gtk-server.cfg</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The 'gtk-server.cfg' file is a configfile which is used by the GTK-server. If
the 'gtk-server.cfg' file is available in the same 
directory as your client script, the GTK-server will read this local configfile
(preferred). This way each client program can use it's own GTK configuration.
If the configfile is not available locally, the GTK-server will follow the next logic:
<P>

1) try reading the environment variable GTK_SERVER_CONFIG. This variable should
contain the full path and name to the configfile.
<P>

2) try finding the (hidden) configfile in the homedir of the user. The name of 
the configfile should be preceded by a dot, e.g. '.gtk-server.cfg'.
<P>

3) try finding the configfile in the /etc directory.
<P>

4) try finding the configfile in the /usr/local/etc directory.
<P>

The 'gtk-server.cfg' file contains the decriptions of the GTK functions which
will be used by your client script. The format of the file is &lt;KEYWORD = VALUE&gt;. Lines
starting with a hash '#' will be skipped. The keywords must be written using capitals.
<P>

The following keywords are recognized by the GTK-server:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LIB_NAME = &lt;library name 1, library name 2, ...&gt;</B><DD>
Describes the name of the libraries (.so or .dll) to open.
This keyword may occur multiple times in the configfile. At a maximum 64 libraries can be opened simultanously.
The library name should end with the plain 'so' suffix. If the GTK-server cannot find the library, it automatically
will append a numeric suffix to the original name varying from 0 to 99 and attempt to open these library names also,
until the correct numeric suffix was found.
<BR>

<P>
Example:
<B>LIB_NAME = libgtk-x11-2.0.so, libgdk-x11-2.0.so, libglib-2.0.so, libgobject-2.0.so</B>

<DT><B>INCLUDE = &lt;file&gt;</B><DD>
Define an additional configuration file with additional GTK function descriptions or macros.
<BR>

<P>
Example:
<B>INCLUDE = /etc/gtk-extra.cfg</B>

<P>
<DT><B>SEQUENCE = &lt;maximum&gt;</B><DD>
When opening a library, the GTK-server will search and attempt to use subsequent library version numbers up to
this definition. The default value is 100.
<BR>

<P>
Example:
<B>SEQUENCE = 10</B>

<P>
<DT><B>FUNCTION_NAME = &lt;func&gt;, &lt;callback&gt;, &lt;type&gt;, &lt;amount&gt;, &lt;arg1&gt;...&lt;argx&gt;</B><DD>
Every GTK function used by a script must be described here. First the name of
the function itself must be mentioned, after that a callback signal if applicable. The real
names for the GTK callback signals must be used here. Then the type of the returnvalue 
must be specified. The type can be one of the following: NONE, VOID, WIDGET, POINTER, BOOL, STRING, INT, LONG, 
DOUBLE, FLOAT or ADDRESS. After that, it must be clear how many arguments the GTK function needs.
Finally, the type of each indivdual argument must be declared. The type of the arguments can
be one of the following: NULL, WIDGET, POINTER, BOOL, STRING, INT, LONG, DOUBLE, FLOAT, ENUM, STR, CLASS,
MACRO, DATA, BASE64 or VARARGS.
<P>
The ADDRESS return type is used to return the address of a function in memory.
<P>
The BASE64 argument type is used to send base64 encoded binary data to the GTK-server. The POINTER argument
type can be used for generic pointers and non-GTK libraries.
<P>
The MACRO argument type can be used in case a user function needs to be registered. In case GTK must execute a user
function, the described macro will be used. A MACRO type always needs a DATA type, in which additional data
can be specified. Macros are explained in the MACRO section of this manpage.
<P>
The ENUM and STR argument types refer to their correspending ENUM_NAME and STR_NAME definitions (see below). Instead of
ENUM, the types INT or LONG may be used as well. Similarly, instead of STR, it is allowed to plainly use STRING.
<P>
The CLASS argument type refers to Motif widget classes. These are hardcoded and cannot be configured in the GTK-server
configuration file.
<P>
The VARARGS argument defines the variable arguments list. The client script can enter a variable amount of arguments,
but each argument should be prefixed with a type indication: i means int, l means long, s means string and so on. The NULL
does not need a prefix.
<P>
The 'gtk-server.cfg' file may not contain duplicate function definitions. This is verified
by the GTK-server during startup. Examples:
<P>
<BR>

<B>FUNCTION_NAME = gtk_window_new, delete-event, WIDGET, 1, LONG</B>

<BR>

<B>FUNCTION_NAME = XtVaCreateWidget, NONE, WIDGET, 4, STRING, CLASS, WIDGET, VARARGS</B>

<DT><B>ENUM_NAME = &lt;name&gt;, &lt;integer&gt;</B><DD>
The GTK and also the XForms API use a lot of predefined constants and enumerations. With this optional
configuration line these can be defined also. The clientscript can use the same enumeration name, and the
GTK-server will substitute to the corresponding value automatically. Values may be entered in decimal, octal
or hexadecimal format. With octal use a preceding '0', and hexadecimal a preceding '0x' or '0X'.
<P>
Please note that enumeration names only may contain integer values. So in a defined GTK function, only at arguments
defined as 'INT', 'LONG' or 'ENUM' the GTK-server will check for an enumeration name. If it cannot match an
enumeration name, it is assumed there is a real value.
<P>
Duplicate enumeration names are not allowed. This is verified by the GTK-server during startup.
<P>
Example:
<B>ENUM_NAME = GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, 0</B>

<DT><B>STR_NAME = &lt;name&gt;, &lt;string&gt;</B><DD>
The Motif API uses a lot of predefined strings. With this optional configuration line these strings can be set to their
real names. The clientscript can use the original string name, and the GTK-server will substitute to the corresponding
real string value automatically.
<P>
The GTK-server will lookup the string names in any argument defined as a STRING.
<P>
Duplicate string names are not allowed. This is verified by the GTK-server during startup.
<P>
Example:
<B>STR_NAME = XmNactivateCallback, activateCallback</B>

<DT><B>ALIAS_NAME = &lt;alias&gt;, &lt;real name&gt;</B><DD>
Some functions in external libraries may have the same name as an existing statement in a programming language. For
example, shell scripts can use the statement 'read', while the function 'read' also can be imported from libc. In
order to avoid the client interpreter mixing up these statements, it is possible to define an alias. So instead of
using the real name, the client program can use the defined alias to invoke the external function.
<P>
Aliasing also allows the programmer to rename external functions so they comply to the standard of the client language.
<P>
Duplicate alias names are not allowed. This is verified by the GTK-server during startup.
<P>
Example:
<B>ALIAS_NAME = libc_read, read</B>

<DT><B>MACRO &lt;name&gt; &lt;...&gt; ENDMACRO</B><DD>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Pointer arguments</H2>

Some GTK functions return a result in their pointer arguments. The way to retrieve the value from
such arguments is to create a definition for the GTK function with special parameters. For example:
<P>
FUNCTION_NAME = gdk_window_get_pointer, NONE, WIDGET, 4, WIDGET, PTR_INT, PTR_INT, NULL
<P>
In this case, a call to 'gdk_window_get_pointer' will return a widget but also the values stored in the
second and third argument. The returned result will be formatted in S-expression syntax, just as
the GTK-server also accepts S-expression syntax. Next to the type PTR_INT the types PTR_LONG, PTR_FLOAT,
PTR_DOUBLE, PTR_STRING, PTR_BOOL, PTR_SHORT, PTR_WIDGET and PTR_BASE64 can be used.
<P>
When actually invoking the defined function, a dummy argument can be used in case of the numeric PTR argument
types. Also the PTR_BASE64 type should have a dummy argument in place.
<P>
The PTR_STRING and PTR_WIDGET argument types however assume a pointer with sufficiently allocated memory.
<P>
In case of the PTR_BASE64 type, the function argument will return a Base64 encoded string which contains binary data.
Before invoking the actual function, make sure to first set the memory layout of the binary data with the internal
gtk_server_data_format function. After that, the returned Base64 string can be decoded using the internal
gtk_server_unpack function.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Macros</H2>

In GTK sometimes more than one function is needed to define a widget. These functions can be
grouped into a macro. From a clientscript the name of the macro can be used to invoke the macro. A 
macro can have the following layout:
<P>
<B>MACRO &lt;name&gt;</B>

<BR>

<B>$a : GTK_function</B>

<BR>

<B>GTK_function $1 $2 $3</B>

<BR>

<B>...</B>

<BR>

<B>RETURN &lt;value&gt;</B>

<BR>

<B>ENDMACRO</B>

<P>
Each line in the macro may contain only one GTK function. A macro can be invoked with arguments.
Within the macro these arguments are denoted with $1, $2, $3 an so on. The $0 points 
to the macroname itself. It is possible to refer to all arguments at once with $@. A macro can 
accept up to 9 arguments. If there are more arguments then these are ignored.
<P>
Macros may also use variables. Variablenames must start with a dollarsign '$'. After that, only the first letter of
the variablename is important, which means that there are at most 26 variables in each macro (lowercase).
<P>
Within a macro, it is possible to assign a result of a GTK function to a variable. However, it is important
that the colon symbol, which is the assignment operator, is not attached to the variablename or the GTK
functionname. For example:
<P>
<B>$window : gtk_window_new GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL</B>

<P>
Also it is possible to assign a string to a variable. To do this, the string should be preceded
by the '&amp;' sign. For example:
<P>
<B>$var : &amp;Hello world</B>

<P>
Variables in macros are initialized to zero automatically, but keep their values after the macro object has been 
executed. Afterwards the variables can be retrieved in your clientscript by using the call 'gtk_server_macro_var'. For example:
<P>
<B>gtk_server_macro_var &lt;macroname&gt; var</B>

<P>
There are a few commands to use in macros. These should be written in capitals. For example, it is possible
to perform a relative jump on the condition of the value of a variable. The command 'VALUE' jumps
when a variable contains a value not equal to zero, and the command 'EMPTY' jumps when a variable is zero. The command 'JUMP' always
jumps, no matter what condition. For example:
<P>
<B>$var VALUE 3</B>

<P>
In this example, the GTK-server will jump three statements forward in case the variable 'var' is not equal to zero. The
commands 'EMPTY', 'VALUE' and 'JUMP' can jump forward and backward, but only within the macro object. Jumps outside
the macro will just go to the end of the macro, or to the beginning if the jump is negative.
<P>
Next to jumps, a comparison between variables can be made with 'COMPARE'. When two variables are compared, the
result of the comparison will be put into the local z-variable. So if the contents of the compared variables are equal, the z-variable
will be '0'. Else the local z-variable will be '1'. For example:
<P>
<B>$event COMPARE $window</B>

<BR>

<B>$z EMPTY -5</B>

<P>
Also it is possible to setup associative arrays. An associative array is globally visible to all macro's. With
associative arrays the main returnvalue of a macro can be connected to another value. This way multiple
results can be returned from a macro. An array with one element can be defined as follows:
<P>
<B>$ebox ASSOC $pix</B>

<P>
If, to another macro, the 'ebox' is passed as an argument, the associated value can be retrieved in that macro as follows:
<P>
<B>$pix GET $1</B>

<P>
In this example, the 'pix' variable will be assigned the value associated to the first argument of the macro. There is no limit
to the amount of associations; associative arrays can be of endless length, for example:
<P>
<B>$ebox ASSOC $pix</B>

<BR>

<B>$pix ASSOC $widget</B>

<BR>

<B>$widget ASSOC $window</B>

<BR>

<B>[...]</B>

<P>
All values can be retrieved using an inverse GET:
<P>
<B>$pix GET $1</B>

<BR>

<B>$widget GET $pix</B>

<BR>

<B>$window GET $widget</B>

<BR>

<B>[...]</B>

<P>
Note that with all operator commands, which are 'GET', 'ASSOC', 'COMPARE', 'VALUE', 'EMPTY', and the ':', the left
operand must be a variable.
<P>
It is not allowed to define a macro within a macro. Also, duplicate macro names are not allowed. However, macros may
invoke other macros. Also, macros may return a value to the client script with the keyword 'RETURN'. For example:
<P>
<B>RETURN $window</B>

<P>
To find out which value is assigned to a variable, the command DEBUG can be used. This will print the result
in the logfile, if logging is enabled. Example:
<P>
<B>DEBUG $button</B>

<P>
The Highlevel Universal GUI (HUG) defined in the GTK-server configfile is implemented using macro objects.
