Howto compile
-------------

1) Compile and install S-Lang and the S-Lang libraries first.

2) Choose a backend, for example: GTK3. Then start the GTK-server configure script as follows: ./configure --enable-slang --with-gtk3

3) Start compilation of the GTK-server with the command 'make'. After that 'make install'.

4) Run the testprogram in the s-lang subdirectory: 'demo-lib.sl'.


The resulting module is tested with S-Lang 2.0.5.
